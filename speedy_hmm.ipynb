    "# HMM code golf\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi! We've built an HMM for detecting [PCR chimeras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(molecular_biology)). <br>\n",
    "We want this HMM to run very fast. <br>\n",
    "If you can speedup any of the two core HMM functions by >= 5x without changing the output, you get authorship on the paper. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to focus on the core algorithms, so run with 1 thread. However, if you can improve the threading that's also a plus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that given a sequence query, we want to determine if it's more likely to observe the query from a database sequence plus a mutation rate, or by the combination of two database sequences plus mutation rate. The states are database sequences and the emission probabilities are affected by the mutation rates. The mutation rates can be either determined by an algorithm (baum welch approach) or given by the user (discrete bayesian approach). The core functions these two methods use are the same and the calls in the examples below use the baum welch approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like two specific functions optimized: get_chimera_probabilities and get_recombination_events. The core algorithms behind these functions are in https://github.com/MurrellGroup/CHMMera/blob/main/src/algorithms.jl . This is where the optimization should happen.\n",
